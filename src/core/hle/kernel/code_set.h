/**
 * Represents executable data that may be loaded into a kernel process.
 *
 * A code set consists of three basic segments:
 *   - A code (AKA text) segment,
 *   - A read-only data segment (rodata)
 *   - A data segment
 *
 * The code segment is the portion of the object file that contains
 * executable instructions.
 *
 * The read-only data segment in the portion of the object file that
 * contains (as one would expect) read-only data, such as fixed constant
 * values and data structures.
 *
 * The data segment is similar to the read-only data segment -- it contains
 * variables and data structures that have predefined values, however,
 * entities within this segment can be modified.
